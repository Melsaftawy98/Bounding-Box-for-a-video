# Bounding-Box-for-a-video (29/06/2022)
Bounding boxes are a fundamental tool in computer vision used to enclose objects of interest within an image or a video. They define the smallest rectangular area containing the target object, making them essential for tasks such as object detection, tracking, and classification. The code  performs image segmentation using a sequence of preprocessing and segmentation techniques.

## Steps:

1. **Convert to Grayscale**: 
   - The input image is converted to grayscale using `im2gray`, which simplifies subsequent processing.

2. **Adjust Intensity**:
   - Image intensities are adjusted to span the full range using `imadjust`, enhancing contrast.

3. **Adaptive Thresholding**:
   - Binary segmentation is performed using `imbinarize` with an adaptive threshold. The sensitivity and polarity are set to target bright foreground objects.

4. **Erosion**:
   - An erosion operation is applied using a rectangular structuring element (`strel`), reducing noise and small regions.

5. **Clear Borders**:
   - Objects connected to the image border are removed using `imclearborder`.

6. **Flood Fill**:
   - A region-growing method (`imsegfmm`) is used to include connected areas based on a weight image computed by `graydiffweight`. This step ensures connectivity and fills specific areas based on a seed point.

7. **Erosion and Hole Filling**:
   - Additional erosion (with a disk-shaped structuring element) is applied to refine the mask.
   - Holes in the segmented mask are filled using `imfill`.

8. **Dilation**:
   - The mask is dilated with a larger disk-shaped structuring element to recover the object's structure and ensure completeness.

9. **Mask Application**:
   - The segmented binary mask (`BW`) is applied to the original image, setting non-target regions to zero, creating a "masked image."
